            <center><h2>collaborative affordances and social proxemics in virtual reality</h2></center>
            Following a long line of research in the psychological community surrounding James J. Gibson's ecological approach to perception, virtual reality scholars have begun to note the importance of the use of the affordance in the qualitative measurement of the fidelity of immersive virtual environments. In this project I take a look at collaborative affordances in terms of an aperture passage task in which virtual reality users work together to cross through apertures of different widths. I also consider the social nuances that affect proxemic behaviors in such a task. <a href="">Click here to read more...</a>

        <center><h2>delimiting peripersonal space in immersive virtual environments</h2></center>
        Inspired by research on proxemics (primarily done by Jeremy Bailenson and his graduate students), this project encompasses the actual delimitation of the peripersonal space boundaries surrounding a person. The project was programmed using Unity Game Engine and Ikinema Orion as well as the HTC Vive. By presenting users with a visual and haptic stimulus, response times to the stimuli under different conditions give us a definitive peripersonal space boundary. <a href="">Click here to read more...</a>
