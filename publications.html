        <!--This project encapsulates the work that I have completed and am in the process of
        completing for my dissertation thesis. My thesis focuses on the interaction of Virtual
        reality users with their immediate space. Commonly known as peripersonal space, This
        space is defined as the perceived reaching and grasping distance around oneself
        [<a href="">Berti and Frasinetti 2000</a>;
        <a href="">Delevoye et al. 2010</a>;
        <a href="">Farnè et al. 2005</a>;
        <a href="">Iachini et al. 2014</a>;
        <a href="">Rizolatti et al. 1997</a>]. Naturally it would seem that the extent of our
        perceived reaching and grasping space would be constrained by the physical limitations
        of the body (i.e., the length of one's own arms). However, neurophysiological studies
        have long supported the fact that this space is modulated, or it expands and contracts,
        based on the characteristics of the interaction taking place
        [<a href="">di Pellegrino and Làdavas 2015</a>;
        <a href="">Hayduk 1983</a>]. Virtual reality presents a unique opportunity that other
        technology does not - it has the ability to evoke sensations of presence and embodiment
        [<a href="">Kilteni et al. 2012</a>;
        <a href="">Normand et al. 2011</a>;
        <a href="">Petkova and Ehrsson 2008</a>;
        <a href="">Slater et al. 2010</a>] and allows users to interact with and manipulate objects
        in a way that is similar to the real world. This interaction space becomes important in
        understanding how to create realistic experiences that provide accurate perceptual feedback
        that allows users to act as if they would act naturally in a real environment. There are
        several applications that provide therapy and assistive care for those with disabilities
        [<a href="">Alcorn et al. 2011</a>;
        <a href="">Boyd et al. 2018</a>;
        <a href="">Lange et al. 2010</a>], military training applications
        [<a href="">Bhagat et al. 2016</a>;
        <a href="">Lele 2013</a>], and architectural and educational applications
        [<a href="">Portman et al. 2015</a>;
        <a href="">Psotka 1995</a>], among many others
        [<a href="">Fox et al. 2009</a>]. In this work, we focus on understanding how a variety of
        interactions occur in this space. In some preliminary work, we found that while modulation
        of this space is present in immersive virtual environments, it is not always parallel to real
        world findings [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2019.2899232" target="_blank">Buck et al. 2019</a>]. Applying a methodology developed and tested
        in a mixed reality environment [<a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fict.2017.00031" target="_blank">Serino et al. 2017</a>], we have been able to
        delineate peripersonal space boundaries in an immersive virtual environment [
        <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/VR46266.2020.00053" target="_blank">Buck et al. 2020</a>]  and intend to gain further understanding of how this space
        behaves based on several different factors. These include properties of self-avatars such as
        the level of embodiment they evoke, their bodily dimensions and visual perspective provided to
        users.

        Work from this project has been published in IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics
        [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2019.2899232" target="_blank">Buck et al. 2019</a>], and at
